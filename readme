To remove file from Git repo
=============================
1.Remove the File Locally:

git rm file_to_remove.txt
# or, to keep it in the working directory
git rm --cached file_to_remove.txt


2. Commit the Removal:

git commit -m "Remove file_to_remove.txt"


3. Push the Changes:

git push origin master


Additional Notes:
If you've already committed the file, removing it using git rm will mark it for deletion in the next commit.
The --cached option in git rm --cached only removes the file from the staging area (index) and keeps it in your working directory. If you don't use --cached, it will remove the file from both the working directory and the staging area.
If the file is already committed, removing it locally won't automatically remove it from a remote repository. You need to push the commit that removes the file to the remote repository.
Be cautious when removing files, especially in shared repositories. Communicate with your collaborators to avoid potential conflicts.
